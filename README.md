## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy on a live system and clone the repository.

<br>

- (Option 1): Clone the repository with link "https"

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/escummy/giphy-api.git
```

- (Option 2): Clone the repository with link "SSH"

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:escummy/giphy-api.git
```

- (Option 3): Download the file.zip to your desktop

<br>

### # Prerequisites

To continue, you need to have installed: `Node`

<br>

(Check in your terminal bash)

```bash
  node --version
```

<br>

Else, Install nodejs from the official site 'version LTS' (Recommended)

[English] - https://nodejs.org/en/ (or) [Spanish] - https://nodejs.org/es/

<br>

## Installing dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies and devDependencies from any package.json

```bash
  npm install
```

<br>

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
  npm start
```

> Runs the app in the development mode.\
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> > The page will reload if you make edits.\
> > You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<br>

## To run tests

Start checking tests with the following command, which will open a debug console and UI interface in the browser to help with the testing process.

```bash
  npm test
```

<br>

## To build in prodcution

Builds the app for production to the `build` or `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

> The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

```bash
  npm run build
```

<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

<br>

## To eject the project

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

```bash
  npm run eject
```

> Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This will launch a web browser that will auto-update every time you save a watched file as(#specify-files-to-watch), but before push to production, we recommend minify the outputs files and caching how this purpose package helper [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) -->
